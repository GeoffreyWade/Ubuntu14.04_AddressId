# This text file is created to describe the Ubuntu_AddressId project and
# the addressId.cpp class file.

The addressId C++ program is designed as a utility extension on Ubuntu 14.04.

The program is created to incorporate the date, netstat, and whois utilities.
At the request of the user, as with any other command from command line, the
user and/or administrator can run the program and the program will identify
what tcp ports are being used, what IP addresses those ports are connected to,
followed by whois each foreign IP address, and then output the date and the
data to a log file.
